The King of Compound Patterns (apparently)

Notes:

The user interacts with the view

The controller asks the model to change it's state. Controller takes actions and interprets them. ie if you click on a button, the controller knows what this means and does something about it

The controller may ask the view to change

The model notifies the view when it's state has changed

The view asks the model for state (directly)
